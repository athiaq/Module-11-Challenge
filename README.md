# Module-11-Challenge

In this assignment, I used automated browsing to inspect the Mars news site to identify which elements to scrape. Next, a beautiful soup object was created to extract text from the  website. A Python dictionary was then stored in a list and printed. 

In the second part of this assignment the dataset was analyzed using Pandas functions to find the coldest and warmest months on mars, the months with the highest and lowest atmospheric pressure, and how many Earth days exist in a Martian year. Plots were generated to answer these questions.
